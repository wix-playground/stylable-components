## Definition

A **slider** an input where the user selects a value from within a given range.

Sliders are great for adjusting settings that reflect intensity levels (volume, brightness, color saturation).



## Elements

![elements](./assets/elements.png)

The handle is dragged across the bar in order to give the slider a desired value. progressBar shows range from min value to the current value while marks and ::progressMarks are representing the step. Tooltip is showing the value.

**Slider consists of:** 

::bar - represents range from min to max value
::progressBar - represents range from min value to the current
::handle - dragged across the bar in order to give the slider a desired value
::marks - represent step within ::bar section
::progressMarks - represent step within ::progressBar section
::tooltip - displays current value

## Behavior

In order to change the value, user can:

1. drag handle over the slider bar 
2. click on the slider bar, mark OR clickable area to select the value from the range
3. click & drag  (click = click on handle, slider, mark & clickable area)

Changing the value is performed **from current value** to the next expected value. 
E.g. if min=0, max=10, step=2, value=3.5, then UP arrow key will give us 4 and Down arrow key will give us 2
Value can not exceed the min/max limits. If value is > or < than min/max it is automatically set to corresponding min/max.

If slider has a step prop set to "number", handle should move across the slider bar only according to the step.

**Alignment & Direction**

You can adjust sliders alignment and direction in which the range is going to change with axis prop.

1. `axis="x"` -> horizontal slider, progress is moving from left to right
2. `axis="x-reverse"` -> horizontal slider, progress is moving from right to left
3. `axis="y"` -> vertical slider, progress is moving from bottom to top
4. `axis="y-reverse"` -> vertical slider, progress is moving from top to bottom


**Tooltip**

To enable tooltip, set `displayTooltip` prop to `true`. 

Tooltip is shown on: 

1. Hover over the "handle"
2. Focus over the "handle"

See [sample slider](https://ant.design/components/slider/).

Tooltip is showing on top of slider for both horizontal & vertical alignment.



#### Validation

| Case                          | Handling          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `value` is less then `min`    | set to `min`      |
| `value` is greater than `max` | set to `max`      |
| `value` is empty              | set to `min` OR 0 |



#### Edge case handling

| Case                                     | Handling                                 | Example                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| value is out of `step`                   | keep current value & display handle at the position that represents this value | `min=0` `max=10` `step=2` `value=3.5`. Handle is displayed at the position that represents 3.5. When user changes value (keyboard / mouse) we move it to the next expected, which is 4 or 2 |
| `step` is not set & `marks` are set to true | show marks at the beginning and at the end of the slider |                                          |
