# Button

The Button component simply wraps a native `<button/>` tag.

Use it as you would a native Button.

The component is used to provide default styling for the buttons.

Guideline:

* If you need your button styled with your theme for buttons, use this component
* If you only need native button functionality, but not the style, use a native button
