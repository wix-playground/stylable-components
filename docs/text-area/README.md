# Text Area

The Text Area component simply wraps a native 	<textarea/> tag.

Use it as you would a native Text Area.

The component is used to provide default styling for a native Text Area component.

Guideline:

- If you need your Text Area styled, use this component
- If you only need native Text Area functionality, but not the style, use a native <textarea/>.
