## Definition

The **NumberInput** component improves upon the native `<input type="number">` by providing ability to customize the stepper arrows design, a common React+Typescript API, and working out the kinks of native implementations.



## Elements

![elements](./elements.png)

The NumberInput consists of a native input and a Stepper subcomponent, which provides customisable Up and Down buttons. Also, you can add elements into it in the prefix and suffix slots, by passing the component children with the corresponding data-slot attribute.

| Hover    | User hovered any part of the component |
| Focus    | Browser is focused on the component    |
| Error    | The `error` property is true           |

## Props

See [README.md](./README.md) for more info.



## UI Customizations

The NumberInput can be customized using:

Tag Selector or class for the main element

`::stepper` subcomponent, which has subcomponents of its own

See [README.md](./README.md) for more info.



## Behavior

Changing value in the input via keyboard precisely mirrors the behavior of the stepper arrows.

Stepping the value (arrows or keyboard) is performed **from current value**. E.g., if current value is 5.2, and step is 2, then UP will give us 7.2 (unless max is less than 7.2), and DOWN will give us 3.2.

When the value to be given by the stepper arrows/keyboard exceeds the min/max limits, the value is set to the corresponding min/max

When the user types a value, it isn't committed until enter, tab, click outside (or other committing events according to the description below) happen.

If the user types a value out of range, the value is set to the corresponding min/max **on commit**.

The component follows the external control pattern (value displayed is defined by the `value` property, and in order for the component to function, it should be bound to a state in the parent component, and the `onChange` handler should be set).

#### Keyboard 

| Keys                  | Action                                   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| type a number         | insert a value without committing it.    |
| up arrow key          | increase value (& commit)                |
| down arrow key        | decrease value (& commit)                |
| fn / ctrl + up / down | increase / decrease value by step * 10 (& commit) |
| tab                   | commits the value if needed, moves to next element (skips the stepper) |
| Shift + tab           | commits the value if needed, moves to previous element |
| enter                 | Commits the value (if value wasn't committed) |
| esc                   | removes focus (if in focus), discards non-committed new value (if value typed) |

**RTL** orientation

| Keys                | Action |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| no special handling |        |



#### Mouse

| Event                   | Action                                   | NOTE |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---- |
| hover                   | triggers the css `:hover` state          |      |
| click inside            | focuses the element, selects all text inside |      |
| click outside           | blurs, commits value if the value is not committed |      |
| click & drag on stepper | increases/decreases the value (on drag up/down or left/right) (& commits) |      |



#### Touch

| Event                   | Action                                   | NOTE                                     |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| tap inside              | same as mouse click                      |                                          |
| tap outside             | same as mouse click                      |                                          |
| drag                    | up/down/left/right - increase/decrease value by step | need to check if it messes with page scroll |
| tap on a stepper button | same as mouse click                      |                                          |



## Error handling

| Error                                    | Handling                                 |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| value (given as prop) out of min/max range | Show error in console                    |
| value (given as prop) out of step (e.g. min=0 / max=10, step=5, value=7) | value is shown as given (is NOT moved to the closest step) |
| user sets value out of range             | set value within range (to max or min)   |
| the `error` property is true             | This is used to give the user ability to manually indicate that there's an error in the input. Will set the `:error` CSS state on the input itself |
