## Definition

A **slider** an input where the user selects a value from within a given range.

Sliders are great for adjusting settings that reflect intensity levels (volume, brightness, color saturation).



## Elements

![elements](./assets/elements.png)

**Slider consists of:** ::bar, ::handle, ::progressBar, ::marks and ::progressMarks . The ::handle is dragged across the bar in order to give the slider a desired value. ::progressBar shows range from min value to the current value. ::marks and ::progressMarks are representing the step

> TBD (need to decide on how to implement tooltip)
> Also, you can display tooltip (e.g. to display current value) by adding child DOM element with relevant data-slot (data-slot="tooltip")

## API

**Props**

See [README.md](https://github.com/wix/stylable-components/blob/master/specs/specTemplate/README.md) for more info.

**Style**

Slider can be customized using ::handle, ::bar, and ::progress subcomponents.

## Accessibility

##### Keyboard behavior

Accessibility for slider is mostly covered with keyboard behavior (according to ARIA docs).
See [keyboard](#keyboard) section for reference.

##### Focus

Focus is placed on the slider (the visual object that the mouse user would move, also known as the thumb).

> NOTE:
> Focus is placed on handle according to ARIA doc

|        | `tabindex=0`            | `div`   | Includes the slider thumb in the page tab sequence. |
|        | `aria-valuemax=255`     | `div`   | Specifies the maximum value of the slider. |
|        | `aria-valuemin=0`       | `div`   | Specifies the minimum value of the slide |
|        | `aria-valuenow=NUMBER`  | `div`   | Indicates the current value of the slider. |
|        | `aria-label`            | `div`   | Defines a string value that labels the current element. |
|        | `aria-labelledby=IDREF` | `div`   | Refers to the element containing the name of the slider. |

## Behavior

In order to change the value, user can:

1. drag handle over the slider bar 
2. click on the slider bar, mark OR clickable area to select the value from the range
3. click & drag  (click = click on handle, slider, mark & clickable area)

Changing the value is performed **from current value** to the next expected value. 
E.g. if min=0, max=10, step=2, value=3.5, then UP arrow key will give us 4 and Down arrow key will give us 2
Value can not exceed the min/max limits. If value is > or < than min/max it is automatically set to corresponding min/max.

If slider has a 'step' prop, handle should move across the slider bar only according to the step.

#### Validation

| Case                          | Handling          |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------- |
| `value` is less then `min`    | set to `min`      |
| `value` is greater than `max` | set to `max`      |
| `value` is empty              | set to `min` OR 0 |



#### Edge case handling

| Case                                     | Handling                                 | Example                                  |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| value is out of `step`                   | keep current value & display handle at the position that represents this value | `min=0` `max=10` `step=2` `value=3.5`. Handle is displayed at the position that represents 3.5. When user changes value (keyboard / mouse) we move it to the next expected, which is 4 or 2 |
| `step` is not set & `displayMarks` is set to true | show marks at the beginning and at the end of the slider |                                          |
