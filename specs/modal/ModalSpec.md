## Definition

The **Modal** component is a window that opens on top of the application's main window. It blocks the main application's interactivity, and the application flow. In practice, it usually leaves the main app visible in the background, faded out. Users must interact with the modal in order to return to the application flow.

## Elements

The modal consists of a header, body and footer. The header usually contains a title and optionally a close button, the body contains the main modal content, and the footer usually contains a primary button and another close button. The modal has a backdrop that blocks interactivity with the rest of the screen.

Interacting with the modal can consist of:  
- clicking its primary button
- clicking its backdrop
- clicking its close/cancel button(s)
