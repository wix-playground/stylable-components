## Definition

A toggle switch is used as an on/off control



## Elements

**Toggle consists of:**  "switch", "icon" and "progress". The "switch" moves across the toggle "background"in order to turn on/off something. Icon, at the same time, represents if value is On or Off.

## Props

See [README.md](./README.md) for more info.

## UI Customizations

Toggle can be customized using ::switch and ::background subcomponents.

See [README.md](./README.md) for more info.

## Behavior

User can hit toggle to switch value to on / off. 

Toggle can be rendered with & without icons (this is controlled by `displayIcon`, `iconChecked` & `iconUnchecked` properties).

The component follows the external control pattern (value & handle position is defined by the `value` property, and in order for the component to function, it should be bound to a state in the parent component, and the `onChange` handler should be set).

### Keyboard

| Keys        | Action                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| tab         | moves to next element                    |
| shift + tab | moves to previous element                |
| enter       | -                                        |
| space       | switch toggle to On / Off correspondingly (if toggle is in focus) |
| esc         | removes focus (if in focus)              |
